# TeamLead Runbook (Simple)

## Start

Send one message:

```text
Use $autonomous-dev-team.
Communication folder: tram/.
Task: <one high-level task>
Start now and execute autonomously.
```

## Expected behavior

1. TeamLead creates/updates `tram/board.md`.
2. TeamLead delegates through `tram/handoffs/`.
3. Roles implement code in main project folders (outside `tram/`).
4. Roles report in `tram/role-outputs/`.
5. QA writes verdict in `tram/qa-reports/`.
6. TeamLead writes final summary in `tram/final/`.

## Continue later

```text
Continue from tram/board.md and finish remaining tasks.
```
