# team Workspace

`team/` is the communication channel for agent coordination.

## Use `team/` for

- planning (`team/board.md`)
- handoffs (`team/handoffs/`)
- role reports (`team/role-outputs/`)
- QA verdicts (`team/qa-reports/`)
- final summary (`team/final/`)

## Do not use `team/` for

- production source code
- project runtime files

All implementation code must live in normal project folders outside `team/`.
